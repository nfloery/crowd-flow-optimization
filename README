## General Introduction

Emergency evacuation is a very important topic in many fields of our daily lifes. We find examples from small scale evacuations of a building, up to to a panic scenario in a stadium, in demonstrations or parades.
History has shown how dangerous such situations can get with many people getting injured or even killed by people pushing each other.


## The Model

For our Simulations We are using the social force model from the papers in our references.
What we try is to focus on some specific variables:
-the desired velocity, people want to reach. This is of course strongly related to the level of panic.
-interaction force: interactions between pedestrians as well as walls and other obstacles influence the flow of people.
Studying different situations we hope to get informations about the resulting speed of a mass of people, the efficiency of the evacuation and the local density of people.


## Fundamental Questions

Can we optimize the flux and efficiency of a evacuation?
  Can a evacuation route positively be manipulated by placing obstacles in the route?
	Is there an analogy to hydrodynamics?	
	What is the influence of the desired velocity on the efficiency of a evacuation? Faster is Slow?


## Expected Results

We expect to enhance a evacuation by placing obstacles in the route. This could reduce the velocity and improve the efficiency of the whole evacuation.
